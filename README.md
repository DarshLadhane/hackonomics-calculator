"The website is primarily hosted on Google Sites for ease of content management and user-friendliness."
"The core interactive component, the Savings Calculator, was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To accelerate development and learn about modern coding practices, I utilized AI tools (e.g., Gemini) to generate initial code snippets for the calculator's structure and core logic. My role involved:
Defining the calculator's requirements and user interface.
Prompting the AI for specific HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.
Reviewing, understanding, and modifying the generated code to fit the project's exact needs and ensure correct financial formulas.
Debugging and testing the calculator for accuracy and responsiveness.
Integrating the custom-coded calculator into the Google Sites platform via GitHub Pages embedding."
